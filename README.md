# Project Kepler 🚀

**Quality Intelligence Operating Model**

---

## What is this?

Project Kepler is our journey to transform QA from reactive testing to proactive quality intelligence. We're building a system where QA understands product vision, design intent, and engineering signals—then makes quality decisions *before* code is written.

**Not a tool. Not a role. A way of working.**

---

## Why "Kepler"?

Johannes Kepler discovered the laws of planetary motion by observing patterns. Similarly, Quality Intelligence is about observing patterns in quality signals, learning from them, and predicting risks before they impact delivery.

## The Transformation

```
Level 0: Reactive Quality
  ↓ (You are here - starting Month 1)
Level 1: Preventive Quality          ← Context briefs, early involvement
  ↓
Level 2: Predictive Quality          ← Quality signals, pattern recognition
  ↓
Level 3: Assisted Quality            ← AI-enhanced analysis and documentation
  ↓
Level 4: Autonomous Quality          ← Future state (not current focus)
```

## Core Principles

1. **Consistency > Completeness** - Small, regular contributions beat perfect one-time documentation
2. **Context Before Execution** - Never test or analyze without clear understanding of WHY
3. **Human Judgment First** - AI assists, never decides
4. **Shared Knowledge** - If it's not in the repo, it will be forgotten or relearned the hard way
5. **Cross-Functional Hub** - QA connects Product vision, Design intent, and Engineering needs

## Quick Start

### For QA Team Members

**Starting Your First Sprint:**

1. **Pick one Business Unit** you're working with
2. **Read** `documentation/business-units/[your-bu]/_bu-context.md`
3. **Before grooming**, create a QA Context Brief for major features
4. **After sprint**, add one learning insight to the Quality Learning Board

**That's it.** Start small. Build the habit.

### For Stakeholders (Product, Design, Engineering)

**How QA will engage differently:**

- **Before grooming:** QA will review product vision and design intent
- **During grooming:** QA will discuss quality risks based on context, not just test scope
- **During sprint:** QA will provide earlier feedback using quality signals and benchmarks
- **After sprint:** QA will capture learnings to improve future sprints

**What you'll notice:**
- Fewer surprises mid-sprint
- Quality discussions happening earlier
- Clearer quality criteria before development
- Documented quality knowledge anyone can reference

## Success Looks Like

**Month 1 (Preventive):**
- QA joins ≥80% of grooming sessions
- Every major feature has a QA Context Brief
- Quality gates are simple but present

**Month 2 (Predictive):**
- Quality signals tracked weekly (hotfixes, rework, late issues)
- Quality Learning Board updated after every sprint
- Team uses ChatGPT/Claude for context analysis

**Month 3 (Assisted):**
- AI usage for risk analysis and test ideation is consistent
- Prompting guidelines established
- Ticket understanding time decreases visibly

**Month 4 (Standardized):**
- QA Playbook published
- Quality benchmarks used consistently
- Monthly Quality Summary shared with stakeholders
- Late-stage issues trending down

## FAQs

**Q: Is this replacing our existing test automation?**
A: No. Quality Intelligence is about *context and decision-making*. Automation execution continues as normal.

**Q: Do I need to document everything perfectly?**
A: No. Consistency > Completeness. One insight per sprint is better than perfect documentation once.

**Q: What if I don't know where to start?**
A: Start with one BU context file. Read it. Then create one QA Context Brief for your next feature. That's all.

**Q: Are we using AI to replace QA?**
A: Never. AI helps with analysis, ideation, and documentation. QA judgment and decision-making remain human.

**Q: How much extra time does this take?**
A: Target is 15-30 minutes per sprint for knowledge capture. The time saved from fewer late-stage issues far exceeds this.

## Current Status

**Phase:** Month 1 - Preventive Quality Foundation
**Focus:** Early QA involvement, context briefs, basic quality gates
**Next Milestone:** 80% grooming attendance + context briefs for all major features

---

## Contributing

Everyone contributes:
- QA: Document context, risks, and learning
- Product: Share vision and goals with QA early
- Design: Share design intent before handoff
- Engineering: Collaborate on quality needs during architecture discussions

**The rule:** If it helps future sprints make better quality decisions, it belongs here.
