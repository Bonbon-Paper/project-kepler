# How It Works - Quality Intelligence

**Please Don't Be Overwhelmed**

Quality Intelligence is not a new tool, not a new role, and not a big-bang change. It is a way for QA to capture context, make better quality decisions earlier, and learn together over time.

You do not need to understand everything at once. **Start small. The system grows with you.**

What matters most is **consistency, not completeness.**

## Summary: The 4-Step Loop

1. **QA absorbs product + design context early**
   - Read product vision, design intent
   - Create QA Context Brief before grooming

2. **QA predicts risks using signals + AI assistance**
   - Track quality signals (hotfixes, rework, late issues)
   - Use AI for context analysis and risk brainstorming
   - Human judgment makes final decisions

3. **QA enables engineering quality before delivery**
   - Collaborate on quality needs during development
   - Sprint quality gates ensure standards met
   - Early feedback prevents late rework

4. **QA captures learning as benchmarks for next sprint**
   - Document insights in Quality Learning Board
   - Build knowledge base as shared benchmarks
   - Patterns inform future risk predictions

## Getting Help

**If you're stuck:**
1. Read [02-your-first-contribution.md](./02-your-first-contribution.md)
2. Pick the smallest possible action (e.g., read one BU context file)
3. Do that one thing
4. Repeat tomorrow

**If something is unclear:**
- Open an issue in the project repository
- Ask in the QA team channel
- Suggest improvements to these docs

**Remember:** This system is built by us, for us. If it doesn't make sense, we fix it together.

## Final Reminder

You do not need to do everything at once.

Start with one BU, one Quality Scope, one learning note.

**Quality Intelligence grows through use, not enforcement.**

Let's build this together. 🚀
